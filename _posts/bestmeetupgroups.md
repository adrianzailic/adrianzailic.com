Bucharest's tech scene is flourishing, with IT professionals and enthusiasts seeking events to network, learn, and share knowledge. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a budding entrepreneur, or simply curious about the latest tech trends, joining a meetup group can be an excellent way to connect with like-minded individuals and stay updated with industry developments. Here are some of the best IT meetup groups in Romania that you should consider being a part of:

### **Cloud Native Bucharest**S
This is perhaps my favorite group in Bucharest. It is comprised of dedicated software engineers and testers interested in designing and building cloud-native applications, microservices architecture, Kubernetes, and maintaining high-quality assurance processes. They typically host one or two events per month, mostly located in the city center, either at their headquarters, Adore's me HQ, or at a partner's venue (often at eSolutions Academy).

### **Stories of the Web**
Hosted by Aleodor Tabarcea in collaboration with Adobe, this meetup series covers a wide range of topics, from career guidance to technical presentations on Adobe products. While it is generally focused more towards students, they also organize events that cater to experienced engineers from time to time.

### **Angular Bucharest (ngBucharest)**
As the name suggests, Angular Bucharest is solely focused on Angular topics. It boasts a vibrant community of Angular enthusiasts. If you're working with Angular, attending their events is a great way to stay informed about upcoming features and to connect with like-minded individuals. It also provides an opportunity to find a buddy with whom you can discuss and debate Angular topics, especially if your project team lacks Angular expertise.

### **RO AI Alliance Bucharest**
While this group leans more towards business-oriented discussions on AI, it still offers valuable insights into the current state of artificial intelligence and its implications. As a hands-on engineer, I didn't find much value in these kinds of presentations. However, it's possible that they've changed their structure since I last attended one of their events.
