On the 4th-5th of March weekend, Codette organized a new edition of it's 2NHack hackathon series with the theme for his year being 'Hack For Humanity'. I was there to speak about Innovation in general and to be a mentor for the participating teams.

But first of all who is Codette? Codette is a Romanian NGO for all people interested in technology, regardless of gender, age, level of experience or the tech branch in which they work. They are focused on promoting diversity and education at all levels and to create opportunities for women to reach their maximum potential.

Their team is really big, currently counting 10+ volunteers that are busy organising many different kinds of events like IOT4All, JSSuperHeroes, GoesMobile, 2NHack, etc.
