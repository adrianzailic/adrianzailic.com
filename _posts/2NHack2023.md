On the 4th-5th of March weekend, Codette organized a new edition of it's 2NHack hackathon series with the theme for his year being 'Hack For Humanity'. I was there to speak about Innovation in general and to be a mentor for the participating teams.

But first of all who is Codette? Codette is a Romanian NGO for all people interested in technology, regardless of gender, age, level of experience or the tech branch in which they work. They are focused on promoting diversity and education at all levels and to create opportunities for women to reach their maximum potential.

Their team is really big, currently counting 10+ volunteers, that are busy organising many different kinds of events like IOT4All, JSSuperHeroes, GoesMobile, 2NHack, etc. You can read more about them in [here](https://codette.ro/).

This year there were 7 teams who participated in the 2NHack hackathon and I was really excited to see that even though many of them were still students, some were able to incorporate AI/ML models in their ideas. AI is no longer a novel topic, it's definitely here now, impacting our lives. And in my opinion it should be mandatory that anyone who holds a CS degree to at least have attened an AI course.
