Who am I? I'm Adrian Zailic, a hands-on software architect/team lead based in Bucharest, Romania,  specializing in Microservices and Single Page Applications (SPA). Always up to date with the latest technologies, closely following all the innovations and changes in the AI/ML space and the web ecosystem.

Recently I decided to go back to blogging as I realized I wanted a space where to share my thoughts, my accomplishments, as well as everything that I love and support from the IT community. 

I will be taking you with me to explore the Romanian Tech scene by writing about local events/meetups, interviewing rockstar software developers from different companies, different tech stacks, and even some who already got to have their own businesses. 

So stay tuned for the upcoming posts...
